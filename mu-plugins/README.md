### How to add Custom Fields to post types

1.  Install the "Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)" plugin with over a million downloads from the plugins menu and activate it.
2.  ACF will show up as "Custom Fields" in the left-side menu. 
3.  Create a new custom field and if required, add it to a specific post type otherwise it will pop up in every post type.
